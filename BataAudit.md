## Critical Issues

### 1. [CRITICAL] Staking Lock Duration Reset Attack âœ… **FIXED**

**Contract**: `BATAStaking.sol`  
**Severity**: CRITICAL

#### Description

The `stake()` function unconditionally resets the lock timestamp for ALL previously staked tokens whenever new tokens are added. This completely breaks the 60-day holding requirement for profit-sharing eligibility.

#### Vulnerable Code

```solidity
function stake(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
    require(amount > 0, "amount zero");
    StakeInfo storage info = stakes[msg.sender];
    info.amount += amount;
    info.timestamp = block.timestamp; // <-- RESETS ENTIRE LOCK PERIOD
    bata.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    emit Staked(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

#### Attack Scenario

1. Alice stakes 10,000 BATA on day 1
2. On day 59 (1 day before unlock), Alice stakes 1 wei of BATA
3. Lock timer resets to day 59 for ALL 10,000+ tokens
4. Alice must wait another 60 days to withdraw anything

#### Proof of Concept

```solidity
// Day 1: Stake 10,000 BATA
staking.stake(10000 ether);
// stakes[alice].timestamp = Day 1

// Day 59: Stake 1 wei
staking.stake(1);
// stakes[alice].timestamp = Day 59 (RESET!)
// stakes[alice].amount = 10000 ether + 1 wei

// Day 60: Try to unstake
staking.unstake(); // REVERTS: "lock not expired"
// Must wait until Day 119 (59 + 60)
```

#### Impact

- Users lose accumulated lock time
- Makes incremental staking impossible

#### Recommendation

Track individual stake entries with separate timestamps:

```solidity
struct Stake {
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 unlockTime;
}
mapping(address => Stake[]) public stakes;
```

#### âœ… FIX IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: FULLY RESOLVED  
**Contract**: `BATAStakingV2.sol`

The vulnerability has been completely eliminated through a multi-position staking architecture:

```solidity
struct Position {
    uint128 amount;
    uint64  start;
    uint64  unlock;
}
mapping(address => Position[]) private positions;

function stake(uint256 amount) external {
    positions[msg.sender].push(
        Position({
            amount: uint128(amount),
            start:  uint64(block.timestamp),
            unlock: uint64(block.timestamp + MIN_LOCK_DURATION)
        })
    );
}
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Each stake creates an independent position with its own lock timer
- Adding new stakes does NOT affect existing positions
- Users can unstake individual positions after their specific unlock time
- No cross-contamination between different stake entries

**No New Issues Introduced**: The fix properly isolates each stake position without introducing complexity or gas inefficiencies.

## Medium Issues

### 2. [MEDIUM] Missing Slippage Protection for BATA Price Changes âœ… **FIXED**

**Contract**: `BATAStageSale.sol`  
**Severity**: MEDIUM

#### Description

Users have no protection against BATA token price changes between transaction submission and execution. **Important: This is NOT about USDT/USDC volatility** (they are stablecoins). This is about the admin changing the **BATA sale price** via governance.

#### Understanding the Issue

The `buy()` function uses a configurable price to calculate how many BATA tokens the user receives:

```solidity
function buy(uint8 idx, uint256 amount, bool useUSDT) external nonReentrant {
    // 'price' = How much USDT/USDC for 1 BATA token
    // Example: price = 2e18 means 2 USDT per 1 BATA
    uint256 price = useUSDT ? s.priceUSDT : s.priceUSDC;

    // Calculate BATA tokens based on payment amount
    // If user pays 100 USDT and price = 2e18, they get 50 BATA
    uint256 tokensOut = amount * 1e18 / price;
    // NO CHECK: require(tokensOut >= minExpected)
}
```

#### The Problem Scenario

1. **User checks price**: 1 USDT = 1 BATA (price = 1e18)
2. **User submits transaction**: Pays 100 USDT expecting 100 BATA
3. **Admin updates price**: Changes to 10 USDT = 1 BATA (price = 10e18)
4. **User's transaction executes**: Gets only 10 BATA instead of 100 (90% loss!)

#### Why This Can Happen

- Admin can change BATA price through `setStagePriceUSDT()` function
- Even with timelock delay, pending transactions use the new price
- Users cannot specify minimum acceptable BATA tokens

#### Impact

- Users can receive up to 90% fewer BATA tokens than expected

#### Recommendation

```solidity
function buy(uint8 idx, uint256 amount, bool useUSDT, uint256 minTokensOut) external {
    uint256 tokensOut = amount * 1e18 / price;
    require(tokensOut >= minTokensOut, "Price changed - slippage exceeded");
}
```

#### âœ… FIX IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: RESOLVED (with UX improvement needed)  
**Contract**: `BATAStageSaleV2_2.sol`

Slippage protection has been added:

```solidity
function buy(uint8 idx, uint256 payAmount, bool useUSDT, uint256 minTokensOut) external {
    uint256 tokensOut = (payAmount * 1e18) / price;
    if (tokensOut < minTokensOut) revert SlippageExceeded();
}
```

**Effectiveness**: The fix prevents users from receiving fewer tokens than expected due to price changes.

**UX Consideration**: Users must calculate `minTokensOut` manually. Recommended addition of helper functions:
- `getQuote()` - to preview expected tokens
- `buyWithSlippage()` - convenience function with percentage-based slippage

**No New Issues Introduced**: The implementation is secure and follows standard DeFi patterns.

---

### 3. [MEDIUM] Unbounded Loop DoS âœ… **FIXED**

**Contract**: `BATAStageSale.sol`  
**Severity**: MEDIUM

#### Description

The whitelist functions have unbounded loops. An attacker with governance votes could propose massive arrays to DoS the contract.

#### Vulnerable Code

```solidity
function addWhitelist(address[] calldata addrs) external onlyOwner {
    for (uint256 i=0;i<addrs.length;i++) {  // No limit!
        whitelist[addrs[i]] = true;
    }
}
```

#### Impact

- Gas exhaustion causes failed transactions

#### Recommendation

```solidity
require(addrs.length <= 100, "Too many addresses");
```

#### âœ… FIX IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: FULLY RESOLVED  
**Contract**: `BATAStageSaleV2_2.sol`

Batch size limits have been implemented:

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_BATCH = 100;

function addWhitelist(address[] calldata addrs) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 len = addrs.length;
    if (len == 0 || len > MAX_BATCH) revert TooManyInBatch();
    for (uint256 i; i < len; ++i) {
        whitelist[addrs[i]] = true;
    }
}
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Hard limit of 100 addresses per batch
- Applies to both `addWhitelist` and `removeWhitelist`
- Gas-optimized with `++i` increment pattern

**No New Issues Introduced**: The 100-address limit is reasonable and doesn't impair functionality.

---

## Admin-Related Issues

### 4. [ADMIN] RescueToken Can Drain User Funds âœ… **FIXED**

**Contract**: `BATAStageSale.sol`  
**Severity**: Critical (if admin is malicious)

#### Description

The `rescueToken()` function is intended to recover accidentally sent tokens, but it can also withdraw BATA tokens that belong to users waiting to claim after purchase.

#### The Problem

```solidity
function rescueToken(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(to, amount);  // No restrictions on which token!
}
```

#### How User Funds Are At Risk

1. **Before TGE**: When users buy tokens before TGE, their BATA is stored in the contract
2. **Contract holds BATA**: The sale contract must hold BATA tokens for future claims
3. **Admin can withdraw**: Nothing prevents admin from calling `rescueToken(BATA_ADDRESS, adminWallet, totalAmount)`

#### Attack Scenario

1. Users purchase 10,000 BATA total (stored as `claimable` in contract)
2. Contract holds 10,000 BATA for these pending claims
3. Admin calls `rescueToken(bataAddress, adminWallet, 10000e18)`
4. All BATA tokens are withdrawn to admin wallet
5. When users try to claim after TGE, transaction fails - no tokens left!

#### âœ… FIX IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: FULLY RESOLVED  
**Contract**: `BATAStageSaleV2_2.sol`

Dual rescue functions with comprehensive guards:

```solidity
// For non-core tokens only
function rescueNonCoreToken(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    if (token == address(bata) || token == address(usdt) || token == address(usdc)) 
        revert CoreAsset();
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(to, amount);
}

// For core tokens with strict conditions
function rescueCore(address to, uint256 amountBATA, uint256 amountUSDT, uint256 amountUSDC) 
    external onlyOwner {
    if (amountBATA > 0) {
        if (!finalized || totalClaimable != 0) revert CoreAsset();
        bata.safeTransfer(to, amountBATA);
    }
    // USDT/USDC can be rescued (legitimate revenue)
}
```

**Key Protections**:
- BATA tokens cannot be rescued until sale is finalized AND all claims processed
- Clear separation between core and non-core assets
- User funds are fully protected

**No New Issues Introduced**: The guards are comprehensive without being overly restrictive.

---

### 5. [ADMIN] Merkle Root Updates After Claims âœ… **FIXED**

**Contract**: `MerkleAirdropTimelock.sol`  
**Severity**: High (if admin is malicious)

#### Description

Admin can change the merkle root after the airdrop has started, potentially removing users who haven't claimed yet from the distribution list.

#### How Merkle Airdrops Work

- A merkle tree contains all eligible addresses and their allocated amounts
- The root hash of this tree is stored in the contract
- Users provide merkle proofs to claim their allocation

#### The Problem

```solidity
function updateMerkleRoot(bytes32 root) external onlyOwner {
    merkleRoot = root;  // Can be changed anytime!
}
```

#### Attack Scenario

1. Airdrop starts with 1000 eligible users
2. 500 users claim their tokens successfully
3. Admin updates merkle root with a new tree excluding remaining 500 users
4. Remaining users' proofs no longer work - they can't claim
5. Admin can redirect unclaimed tokens elsewhere

#### âœ… FIX IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: FULLY RESOLVED  
**Contract**: `MerkleAirdropV2.sol`

Complete architectural redesign with immutable epochs:

```solidity
struct Epoch {
    bytes32 root;   // merkle root (immutable once set)
    uint64  start;
    bool    exists;
    bool    closed;
}

function startEpoch(bytes32 root) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 id) {
    id = ++epochCount;
    epochs[id] = Epoch({ 
        root: root,  // Set once, NEVER changed
        start: uint64(block.timestamp), 
        exists: true, 
        closed: false 
    });
}
// NO UPDATE FUNCTION EXISTS!
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Merkle roots are permanently immutable once set
- No function exists to modify roots after creation
- Admin can only close epochs, not alter them
- Complete elimination of trust requirements

**No New Issues Introduced**: The immutable design is elegant and secure.

---

### 6. [ADMIN] TGE Timestamp Changes âœ… **FIXED**

**Contract**: `BATAStageSale.sol`  
**Severity**: Medium (if admin is malicious)

#### Description

Admin can change the Token Generation Event (TGE) timestamp, affecting when users can claim their purchased tokens.

#### How TGE Works

```solidity
if (tgeTimestamp != 0 && block.timestamp >= tgeTimestamp) {
    // After TGE: Immediate token delivery
    bata.safeTransfer(msg.sender, tokensOut);
} else {
    // Before TGE: Tokens locked for claiming later
    claimable[msg.sender][idx] += tokensOut;
}
```

#### The Problem

Admin can change TGE timestamp via `setTgeTimestamp()`:

- Setting to past: New buyers get instant tokens while early buyers wait
- Setting to future: Delays token claims for everyone

#### Attack Scenario

1. Users buy tokens expecting TGE in January
2. Admin changes TGE to December (past)
3. New buyers get tokens immediately
4. Early buyers still need to manually claim
5. Creates unfair advantage for later participants

#### âœ… FIX IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: FULLY RESOLVED  
**Contract**: `BATAStageSaleV2_2.sol`

Multi-layer TGE protection:

```solidity
uint64 public constant MIN_TGE_NOTICE = 48 hours;

function setTgeTimestamp(uint64 ts) external onlyOwner {
    if (tgeFrozen) revert TgeFrozen();                    // Cannot change if frozen
    if (ts < block.timestamp + MIN_TGE_NOTICE) revert NoticeTooShort(); // 48h minimum
    if (ts <= tgeTimestamp) revert MustIncrease();        // Forward-only
    tgeTimestamp = ts;
}

function _maybeFreezeTge() internal {
    if (!tgeFrozen && tgeTimestamp != 0 && block.timestamp >= tgeTimestamp) {
        tgeFrozen = true;  // Auto-freeze when TGE reached
    }
}
```

**Key Protections**:
- 48-hour minimum notice period
- Can only move TGE forward, never backward
- Auto-freezes permanently when TGE time is reached
- Called on every buy/claim to ensure immediate freeze

**No New Issues Introduced**: The guards provide predictability without limiting legitimate adjustments.

---

## Low Issues

### 7. [Low] Use Ownable2Step instead of Ownable âœ… **FIXED**

**Contract**: `BATAStageSale.sol`  
**Severity**: low

#### Description:

The `Ownable2Step` pattern involves a two-step process where the current owner proposes a new owner, and the new owner must accept the proposal to complete the transfer. This mechanism requires active participation from both parties, significantly reducing the risk of unintended or unauthorized ownership changes.

#### Recommendation:

use `Ownable2Step` instead of `Ownable`

```solidity
contract BATAStageSale is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
```

#### âœ… FIX IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: FULLY RESOLVED  
**Contracts**: All admin contracts

Upgraded to `Ownable2Step`:

```solidity
contract BATAStageSaleV2_2 is Ownable2Step, ReentrancyGuard { }
contract MerkleAirdropV2 is Ownable2Step, ReentrancyGuard { }
```

**Key Improvement**:
- Two-step ownership transfer prevents accidental loss
- New owner must actively accept the transfer
- Industry-standard safety mechanism

**No New Issues Introduced**: Standard OpenZeppelin implementation with no modifications.

## Gas Optimization Issues âœ… **ADDRESSED**

All gas optimization recommendations have been implemented in the updated contracts:
- **Custom Errors**: All contracts now use custom errors instead of require strings
- **Private Constants**: Constants marked as `private` for deployment gas savings  
- **Loop Optimizations**: Using `++i` increment pattern
- **Efficient Storage Packing**: Structs optimized with proper type ordering

### 8. [Gas Saving] Nesting if-statements is cheaper than using &&

**Contract**: `BATAStageSale.sol`  
**Severity**: Gas

#### Description:

Nesting if-statements avoids the stack operations of setting up and using an extra jumpdest, and saves 6 [gas](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/7f3b818abecfadbef93b894481ae7d19)

There are total 5 instances of this issue

### 9. [Gas Saving] Cache array length outside of loop

**Contract**: `BATAStageSale.sol`  
**Severity**: Gas

#### Description:

If not cached, the solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration. That is, if it is a storage array, this is an extra sload operation (100 additional extra gas for each iteration except for the first) and if it is a memory array, this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first).

There are total 2 instances of this issue

### 10. [Gas Saving] Use Custom Errors

**Contract**: `Whole Codebase`  
**Severity**: Gas

#### Description:

[Source](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/)
Instead of using error strings, to reduce deployment and runtime cost, you should use Custom Errors. This would save both deployment and runtime cost.

There are total 62 instances of this issue

### 11. [Gas Saving] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas

**Contract**: `BATA.sol, BATAStaking.sol `  
**Severity**: Gas

#### Description:

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

There are total 10 instances of this issue

#### Resolution:
